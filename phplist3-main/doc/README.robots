Placing a robots.txt file in the web root directory can help stop anti-malware software or email servers
"following" links in an email. That can lead to unauthorised unsubscriptions when UNSUBSCRIBE_JUMPOFF is set to 1.

Create a robots.txt file in the web root directory with these lines or add to an existing robots.txt file
adjusting if necessary to the actual directory in which phplist is installed.

user-agent: *
disallow: /lists/
